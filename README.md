}

./.env.development.local
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres'
...

./prisma/schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url = env("POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL") // uses connection pooling
  directUrl = env("POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING") // uses a direct connection
}
